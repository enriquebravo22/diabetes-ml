# ðŸ§  Diabetes Diagnosis Prediction using Machine Learning

This project explores the application of various machine learning models to classify patients into **diabetic**, **pre-diabetic**, or **healthy**, based on clinical data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

We use a dataset consisting of **21 clinical attributes** per patient, including biometric measurements, lab results, and lifestyle factors.

- Total samples: [X] patients
- Classes:
  - 0: Healthy
  - 1: Pre-diabetic
  - 2: Diabetic

*(Dataset source: (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators))*

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal is to **build a predictive model** that can accurately classify a patient's diabetic condition using the provided attributes. This can be used as a support tool for early detection and prevention of diabetes.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Methods

### ðŸ”¬ Supervised Learning:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP / Neural Network)**

### ðŸ§ª Feature Selection:
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Feature importance from tree-based models
- Correlation analysis

### ðŸ§­ Unsupervised Learning:
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **Unsupervised KNN (distance-based grouping)**

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- ROC and AUC curves
- Silhouette score (for clustering)
- 
## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the notebook.
